# Uberspinners

This repository contains the static assets for **uberspinners.com**, a vibrant social casino lounge.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Public landing page covering the studio overview, resources, and contact routes.
- `styles.css` – Shared styling for the entire experience.
- `public/` – Brand imagery, icons, and compliance badges referenced throughout the site.
- Supporting directories (`privacy/`, `terms/`, etc.) – Legacy policy and compliance pages kept for reference.

## Development

The project is fully static. Update HTML or CSS directly, then redeploy via your preferred static host/CDN.

If new routes are added, remember to refresh `sitemap.xml` so crawlers stay in sync.
